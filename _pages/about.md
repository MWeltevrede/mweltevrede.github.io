I'm a PhD researcher in the Sequential Decision Making group at the Delft University of Technology supervised by [Matthijs Spaan](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/mtjspaan/) and [Wendelin BÃ¶hmer](https://reinforceai.net). I do research in reinforcement learning with a focus on developing RL agents that can generalise to new scenarios. Currently, I investigating the role of exploration for improving generalisation performance, as well as the zero-shot generalisation capabilities of offline RL agents. 

Generally, I am interested in many things. At the moment this includes generalisation, adaptation, continual learning, causality, physics, the scientific method, software engineering, playing guitar, singing, painting and collecting fossils.
